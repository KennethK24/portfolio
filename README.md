# Introduction - Mechanical Engineering Projects Portfolio 

Hello there! Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio!     

I've made this GitHub the homebase for showcasing the projects that best depict the skills I've picked up so far.  
<sub> (GitHub is surprisingly good at organizing and displaying stuff) </sub>

#### In this repository, each folder is titled with the project name. Within each folder there will be a markdown file with at least five of these components to help guide you through from project prompt to presentation:

## Introduction

## Background 

## Images/Renders

## Equations and Discussion 

## Takeaways 

#### The markdown files in each folder are the detailed summaries of the projects, and the reasoning and methods of how I approached and completed each part of the project that I've worked on. 

#### They will be labled as "projectoverview.md". Each folder is structured so that upon reading the summary, if you are curious about further details that I did not mention, you are able to reference the actual project files that I've used to complete the assignment.
