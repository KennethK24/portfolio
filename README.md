# UNDERCONSTRUCTION Introduction - Mechanical Engineering Projects Portfolio 

Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio!     

I've made this GitHub the homebase to showcase the projects that best depict the skills I've picked up so far.  
<sub> (GitHub is surprisingly good at organizing and displaying stuff) </sub>

## Structure of this repository 
### In this repository, each folder is titled with the project name. Within each folder there will be a markdown file with at least five of these components to help guide you through from project prompt to presentation:

#### Introduction
This is where the project's main tasks and goals are described. Essentially, it can be thought of the as main summary of the project.

#### Background 
This is where the technical terms are explained. If there is less common terminology described in the introduction, chances are it might be in here, so if at anytime you find a word or method that is unfamiliar please check here! Figures of the definitions helping to explain will also be referenced here.    

It may be worth reading through the entirety of the introduction before referencing the background. From my persepective, it may be easier to follow along the description first, then the definition of each new terminology.  


#### Images/Renders
The images of the actual designs of the project will go here, different from the figures used to explain in the background.   


#### Equations 
The equations used in the project. The technical explanations of the project. Each equation will have their variables explained and may be integrated with other equations depending on its output.   


#### General Discussion/Conclusion 
The part where I discuss the results and what they achieved or how they connect back to the initial introduction.  


### The markdown files in each folder are the detailed summaries of the projects, including the reasoning and the methods of how I approached and completed each part of the project that I've worked on. 

### They will be labled as "projectoverview.md". Each folder is structured so that upon reading the summary, if you are curious about further details that I did not mention, you are able to reference the actual project files that I've used to complete the assignment.
