# Introduction - Mechanical Engineering Projects Portfolio 

Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio!     

I've made this GitHub the place to put the powerpoint presenation to showcase the projects that best depict the skills I've picked up so far.  
          
## Structure of the Presentation 
### In this presentation, there is a table of contents of each project that I have completed. For each project, there is a introduction and background of the project followed by images.

#### Introduction
This is where the project's main tasks and goals are described. Essentially, it can be thought of the as main summary of the project.

#### Background 
This is where the images and renders of the projects are located. The captions under the figures give a brief description of what was completed in the project. 

#### How to use: 
To access the powerpoint presentation, click on the Projects Presentation.pptx on and click the "view raw" link to download the presentation.  

In the presentation there is a table of contents with rectangle next to each project title that you can ctrl+click to jump to each project. If you wanted to return to the table of contents, click the first title slide of each project and then click on the "Back to Table of Contents". <br><br>

If you are in an another slide, click on the house shaped button on the bottom left to jump to the title slide of the project and then ctrl+click to go back to the Table of Contents.
