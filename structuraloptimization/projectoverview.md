# Structural Optimization Project 
Project overview

## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to become familiarized with the structural optimization process of a given structure. In this project, a half Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) beam was used as the structure model to optimize. 

## Background 
- **Topology optimization** is a method to determine an object’s optimal design given a specific set of criteria and constraints that the design needs to achieve. This method uses algorithms to add and remove material within a specified design space. It uses the finite element analysis (FEA) model, and iteratively calculates each element to see if the element experiences loading. If not, then the algorithm removes the element and thus the material is slowly optimized by this repetition.
- The **Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) half beam** is a common technique to model a full beam that is often supported vertically on both ends, into half of its actual structure assuming symmetry of both geometry, loads, and load locations. Figure 1 is the
